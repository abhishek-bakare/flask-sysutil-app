# SystemUtil web application using Flask with Docker & Kubernetes
Here I used Python Flask framework and created simple System utilization website that tells CPU & memory utilization.
You can see Dockerfile which creates images using Python alpine image.

Then I have created Kubernetes Deployment & Service to create replicas & service as a NodePort.
Feel free to use.
